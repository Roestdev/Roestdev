👋 Hi, I’m @Roestdev (a.k.a. Willem)

Currently I am trying to learn Biblical Hebrew and Rust. 😄

While learning these two languages I decided to combine them.  
So I started writing a Rust program ( to search the Westminster Leningrad Codex (WLC).

My current idea/view is the following:
1. A main crate ([**swlc-rs**](https://github.com/Roestdev/swlc-rs)), which contain the following workspaces:
 -  a number of specific common libraries 
 -  a code generator
 -  a CLI
 -  a GUI
2. General library crates (two at this moment)
-  [**hebrew_unicode_script**](https://github.com/Roestdev/hebrew_unicode_script) low-level crate (work in progress)   
-  [**hebrew_unicode_utils**](https://github.com/Roestdev/hebrew_unicode_utils)  will use the low-level crate (only a quick setup)
